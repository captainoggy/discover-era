# Discover Era

It is an online library where users can find their favorite book or rediscover an old classic. With inspiration from GoodReads, this single page web application improves the user's experience by eliminating whitespaces and allowing for a more wide spread browse feature. Once a user finds a book which they love, they can add it to a number of different bookshelves in order to save them for later.
